# Multiple Languages with .NET MAUI

Let's create multiple languages for our .NET MAUI - This time, I'll be using ENGLISH for default language and PT-BR for secondary.

## 01. Default App Language:

To set our *'default'* language, we need to create a file called **AppResources.resx**. <br>
 - I've created mine on the folder ````Resources\Languages\AppResources.resx````
